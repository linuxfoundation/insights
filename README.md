# LFX Insights

## What is LFX Insights?
Insights evaluates the health and trustworthiness of the world's most critical open source software.

## Contributing

Insights is part of the [LFX platform](https://lfx.linuxfoundation.org/). Therefore, it's not straight forward to run the application locally with relevant data to test. For this reason, outside code contributions are not yet intended. Nevertheless, there are still ways to contribute and help us improving Insights:

- Create issues every time something goes wrong or you have a feature idea
- Upvote issues with üëç reaction so we know what's the demand for a particular issue to prioritize it within the roadmap

### Requirements

- Node 18+
- pnpm 9+
- Husky 9+
- Nuxt 3+
- PrimeVue 4+
- Pinia 2+

## Maintainers
LFX Insights is a project by [The Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). You can find a list of the individual maintainers [here](MAINTAINERS.md).
