## What is Insights?
[Insights](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/) evaluates the health of the world's most critical open source software.

At the core, Insights analyzes the following vectors to define a project's health:
- <b>Contributors</b>: Who is contributing on behalf of which company? (Leaderboards, Contributor/Organization dependency, etc)
- <b>Popularity</b>: How well is the project being adopted? (Package downloads, Search queries, Mailing list messages, etc)
- <b>Development</b>: How actively is the project being maintained? (Issue resolution, PR lead time, Active days, etc)
- <b>Security & Best Practices</b>: Is the project following security & best practices? (supported by [OSPS Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org/))

Learn more about how Insights works in our [Documentation](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/docs).
