# The First 3 Months of Insights – A Brief Recap

At the end of May 2025, we relaunched **LFX Insights** with a focus on measuring open source health for the world's most critical projects.

While Insights isn’t entirely new, the relaunch marked a major step forward. We introduced:

- A [completely revamped app](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/)
- An [open source codebase](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/insights)
- Support for projects outside of the Linux Foundation (“non-LF projects”)

## Insights' Growth in Numbers

So far, Insights monitored:

- **15k repositories** across **953 LF projects** and **170 non-LF projects**
- **330m activities**
- **1.9m contributors**
- **526k organizations**

The feedback we have received is overwhelmingy positive. And we can also see the growing popularity of Insights in numbers:

- **4,500+ monthly visitors** in August
- **9 pages per visit** on average
- **~12 minutes time on site**

These engagement numbers show that people don't just visit Insights, they dive deep.

## Adoption Across Communities

A big milestone was the adoption of our new **Health Score**. Communities are already adding the Health Score badge to their repositories. Among them are well-known projects such as [Helm](https://github.com/helm/helm), [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/framework), [Matplotlib](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib), [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch), and [Bazzite](https://github.com/ublue-os/bazzite).

These projects are helping set a standard for transparent health metrics in open source.

## Sharing Insights Around the World

Over the summer, we had the chance to bring Insights to global audiences at **OSS Summits in North America, India, and Europe**.

The talks sparked discussions on how communities and organizations can use data to better understand the health and sustainability of the projects they rely on.

## Outlook

The first three months showed us that there’s strong demand for open, data-driven views of open source projects. We’re just getting started.

In the coming year we will:

- Expand coverage to **10k critical open source projects**
- Launch **refined methodology for [measuring project criticality](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/critical-projects)**
- Explore **new ways to surface actionable insights** to maintainers, contributors, and organizations

Stay tuned and if you haven’t yet, explore Insights for yourself at [insights.linuxfoundation.org](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org).
