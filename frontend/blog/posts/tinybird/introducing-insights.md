# Introducing Insights
Open source is the backbone of modern software. It runs our infrastructure, fuels our products, and drives innovation across every industry. Our digital lives rest on projects we donâ€™t control but depend on every day.

The challenge: not all projects are equal. Some are maintained by large, diverse contributor bases. Others hinge on a handful of individuals. Some projects are responsive to security issues, while others leave risks unaddressed. Until now, it has been hard to answer a simple but critical question: how healthy are the projects we depend on? 

Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re building [Insights](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/).

## What is Insights?
Insights is the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/)â€™s platform for understanding open source project health.

Stars and download numbers donâ€™t tell the full story. What matters is whether there are enough active maintainers, how diverse the contributor base is, how quickly issues get resolved, whether security practices are in place, and whether risky dependencies or vulnerabilities exist.

Insights brings these signals together. It pulls data from more than 20 sources - code repositories, package managers, mailing lists, and community platforms - and distills it into a single Health Score that highlights strengths and flags risks.

Right now, Insights covers over 1,000 Linux Foundation projects, and weâ€™re expanding it to include critical non-LF projects as well.

With Insights, you can:
- Explore the [LF Open Source Index](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-index), which maps the Top 10k most critical projects across stacks and industries
- Review metrics and a Health Score across contributors, popularity, development, and security & best practices in one place ([example: Kubernetes](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/k8s?timeRange=past365days&start=2024-08-20&end=2025-08-20))
- Analyze both Linux Foundation (LF) and non-LF projects that matter to your stack

## Whatâ€™s next for Insights
Insights was relaunched in May 2025 with a focus on clarity, transparency, and usability for developers. But this is just the beginning. Our next steps are to:
- Expand coverage to the Top 10,000 most critical projects across ecosystems.
- Improve metrics with input from maintainers, contributors, and end users.
- Add more features that make Insights more actionable â€” from maintainer recommendations to side-by-side project comparisons.

Our vision is to make Insights the go-to platform for evaluating open source health - not just for Linux Foundation projects, but for the ecosystem as a whole.
