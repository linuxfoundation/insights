# Security & Best Practices

The control assessments that we run for "Security & Best Practices" are powered by the [Open Source Project Security Baseline](https://baseline.openssf.org) by OpenSSF.

Please note that Insights only runs control assessments that work without privileged access to a project's codebase.

To improve security & best practices, we recommend maintainers to check out the Baseline project and validate all control assessments.
