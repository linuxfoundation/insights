# 🩺 Health Score Explained

The Health Score in LFX Insights is **a single, unified metric (0–100) that reflects the overall health and trustworthiness of an open source project**. It’s designed to give developers a quick, high-confidence signal about whether a project is actively maintained, widely used, secure, and well-governed.

::: warning ⚠️ Please note
While the Health Score provides a useful, data-driven snapshot of a project's overall state, no single score can capture all the nuance of an open source project. Different projects serve different goals—some are mature and stable, others are experimental or niche by design. This scoring model is meant to highlight potential signals and risks, not to make final judgments. Always consider context and use your own judgment alongside the score.

## Insights Health Score Formula

The Insights Health Score is calculated as the sum of four equally weighted categories:

**Health Score (0-100 pts) = Contributors (0–25 pts) + Popularity (0–25 pts) + Development (0–25 pts) + Security & Best Practices (0–25 pts)**

The aggregated score is evaluated as follows:

- **> 90 pts**: Rock Solid
- **76 - 90 pts**: Healthy
- **51 - 75 pts**: Stable
- **25 - 50 pts**: Unsteady
- **< 25 pts**: Critical

To fit into the Health Score model, the score is divided by 4 to yield a maximum of 25 points.

**Example:** If a project has an OSPS Baseline result of 80: 80 ÷ 4 = 20 points
