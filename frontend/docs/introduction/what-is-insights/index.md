# What is LFX Insights?

LFX Insights helps developers and their organizations make smarter decisions about the open source projects they depend on.

Before adding a new dependency, you’ve probably asked yourself: <i> Is this open source project actively maintained? Is it secure and trustworthy? Will it still be around in a year?</i>

We built Insights to answer those questions.

Think of Insights as <b>a health check for open source projects</b> - a platform that gives you a clear, data-driven view of a project’s activity, contributor base, security posture, and long-term stability.

With LFX Insights, you can:

- <b>Quickly assess a project’s overall health</b> - with an at-a-glance summary of key activity, community, and security signals.
- <b>Understand who is behind a project</b> - see contributor affiliations and organization-level insights, not just anonymous GitHub handles.
- <b>See whether a project follows security best practices</b> - including vulnerability management, documentation quality, and governance signals.
- <b>Track adoption and momentum</b> - through benchmarks, usage patterns, and trends across the open source ecosystem.

Built by the <a href="https://www.linuxfoundation.org">Linux Foundation</a>, LFX Insights leverages trusted, high-quality data to help you reduce risk and choose open source projects that are not just functional—but reliable.


## Why It Matters
Today's world is built on open source software. But as our stack grows, so does the complexity—and with it, the risk. Incidents like the XZ backdoor, log4shell, or even the sudden removal of left-pad highlight how fragile the software supply chain can be.

And while metrics like GitHub stars may look reassuring, they often hide deeper issues. A project might seem popular but have no meaningful governance, no active maintainers, or poor security hygiene.

Insights acts as your early warning system. It helps you avoid risky dependencies before they impact your stack—and guides you toward open source you can build on with confidence.

Because software development is not just about what works today. It’s about what lasts.

## Outlook
Insights was relaunched in May 2025 with a renewed focus on clarity, transparency, and usability for developers.

As of today, the platform <b>covers 1,000+ open source projects hosted by the Linux Foundation</b> - including many of the most critical and widely used projects in the software ecosystem.

But this is just the beginning.

Our vision is to make LFX Insights the go-to platform for evaluating all major open source projects, not just those under the Linux Foundation umbrella. Over the coming months, <b>Insights will expand and include all critical open source projects</b>.

We’re building in the open. If you have feedback, questions, or ideas, we’d love to hear from you. Your input will help shape the future of LFX Insights as we work toward a more transparent and trustworthy open source ecosystem.
