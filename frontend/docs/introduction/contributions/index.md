# Contributions

## What is a Contribution?

A **contribution** is any meaningful activity performed by a contributor that adds value to a software project, community, or ecosystem. This includes both code and non-code efforts, tracked across platforms like GitHub or Groups.io. Learn more about the [data sources](../data-sources/index.md) we currently track.
