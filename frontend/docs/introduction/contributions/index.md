# Contributions & collaborations

Insights tracks activity across platforms to capture the diverse ways individuals support open source projects. This activity is used to understand individual impact, engagement patterns, and participation across projects, communities, and platforms. 
Activities are grouped into two categories: **contributions** and **collaborations**, highlighting both technical work and broader engagement.

**1. Contributions**\
Contributions reflect meaningful technical and community-driven impact. They represent direct work that adds code or technical value to a project. This includes commits, pull requests, code reviews, and related technical activities.

**2. Collaborations**\
Collaborations signal engagement or coordination rather than direct contributions, they capture non-code activities that support the project, including discussions, documentation, planning, and community engagement.
