# LF Open Source Index

How we define which projects are included in Insights.

## What is the LF Open Source Index?
The LF Open Source Index is a curated view of the most critical open source projects powering our modern digital infrastructure. It defines the scope of projects shown in LFX Insights, helping developers, maintainers, and organizations understand what’s truly foundational to the open source ecosystem.

## Which projects are included
At its core, the LF Open Source Index (and therefore Insights) includes:

- **All Linux Foundation-hosted projects**, across all Linux Foundation (LF) initiatives and foundations - see [here](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/projects/).
- **Critical non-LF projects** that are widely adopted and essential to a global developer audience.

We aim to cover projects that are not just active, but impactful and deeply integrated into the technology stack of the modern world.

## How we define "critical" projects

To identify critical open source projects outside of the LF, we rely on the [OpenSSF Criticality Score](https://github.com/ossf/criticality_score) — an open-source metric that evaluates projects based on:

- GitHub activity and contributor base
- Project dependencies
- Popularity indicators (e.g., stars, forks)
- Community responsiveness and velocity

In the future, **we aim to cover the Top 10,000 projects by Criticality Score**. This roll-out will take place gradually.

### Manual curation

While the index is data-driven, we apply a layer of manual curation to maintain quality and relevance:

- We exclude projects that are pure documentation or mirrors (e.g., kernel mirrors).
- We aim to avoid duplication, noise, or “ghost repositories”.

Our goal is not quantity, but clarity - showcasing the projects that companies and developers rely on.

## Evolving scope

The LF Open Source Index is not static. As the ecosystem evolves, we continuously review and consider:

- New LF projects
- Emerging non-LF projects
- Projects that have become deprecated or inactive

If you have any questions or feedback, please reach out to us at [insights@linuxfoundation.org](mailto:insights@linuxfoundation.org). We are open to improving the selection process together with the community.
