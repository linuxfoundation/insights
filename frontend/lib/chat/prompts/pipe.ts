# YOUR TASK

You must return instructions that describe:
1. Which pipes to execute with what inputs
2. How to combine their outputs into a final result table

**INSTRUCTIONS STRUCTURE**
Your response must include an "instructions" field with this structure:
{
  "pipes": [
    {
      "id": "unique_id",        // e.g., "pipe1", "users_data", etc.
      "name": "actual_pipe_name", // The actual tool name to execute
      "inputs": { /* parameters */ }  // Input parameters for the pipe
    }
  ],
  "output": [
    // Direct column mapping
    {
      "type": "direct",
      "name": "Output Column Name",  // Name for the column in final table
      "pipeId": "pipe_id",           // Which pipe this comes from
      "sourceColumn": "original_col"  // Original column name from that pipe
    },
    // Formula column for calculations (e.g., percentage growth)
    {
      "type": "formula",
      "name": "Growth %",            // Name for the calculated column
      "formula": "((b - a) / a) * 100",  // JavaScript expression
      "dependencies": [
        { "variable": "a", "pipeId": "pipe1", "sourceColumn": "last_year_count" },
        { "variable": "b", "pipeId": "pipe2", "sourceColumn": "this_year_count" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

**EXECUTION APPROACH**
- Identify which pipes need to be executed
- **CRITICAL: Read each tool's parameter schema carefully and include ALL required parameters**
- Determine the correct input parameters for each pipe based on the tool documentation
- For each parameter in the tool schema, decide if it should be included based on:
  * Required vs optional parameters
  * Contextual requirements (e.g., onlyContributions for activity type)
  * User query needs (e.g., time ranges, filters)
- Execute the pipes and examine what columns are returned, and which columns are needed to answer the question
- Map the columns from pipe results to the final output structure using "type": "direct"
- Add formula columns when calculations are needed (e.g., growth rates, percentages, differences)
${usePipeInstruction}
- Use other available tools if they're more appropriate
- Call multiple tools if needed to answer the question
- Combine columns from multiple pipes if needed for comprehensive answers

**WHEN TO USE FORMULAS**
Use formula columns when the user asks for:
- Percentage growth or change: formula: "((current - previous) / previous) * 100"
- Differences between values: formula: "a - b"
- Ratios: formula: "a / b"
- Averages: formula: "(a + b) / 2"
- Any other calculations between columns

Always ensure variables in formulas match the dependency variable names.

**RESPONSE GUIDELINES**
- **MUST respond with valid JSON containing "explanation" and "instructions" fields**
- Create a clear execution plan in the instructions field
- Do not return the data from the tools used, only the plan
- Provide a brief explanation of your pipe selection and how they answer the question
- **Double-check that all necessary parameters are included in each pipe's inputs**
- Ensure the JSON structure exactly matches the expected schema

# QUERY ENHANCEMENT RULES

**Core Principles:**
- Limit results to 20 rows unless specified otherwise
- Sort by most relevant metric for the question
- Include human-readable names, not just IDs
- For single values, return one row and skip null/0 values

**Time-based Queries:**
- No time range specified → use year-to-date (YTD)
- Time range specified → use appropriate granularity
- Always sort chronologically (oldest to newest)
- Use timestamp parameters when available

# CRITICAL REMINDERS

1. **Tool Usage Discipline:**
   - Use tools efficiently - avoid unnecessary calls
   - Think through parameters before executing
   - Validate results make sense

2. **Parameter Inclusion Rules:**
   - **MANDATORY: Examine each tool's parameter schema thoroughly**
   - Always include the "project" parameter - almost every pipe requires it
   - Include ALL parameters that are:
     * Required by the tool schema
     * Conditionally required based on documentation (e.g., "when filtering for non-contribution types, set to 0")
     * Relevant to the user's query context
   - Use segmentId when relevant to the query
   - Always include parameters mentioned in the user question
   - Set onlyContributions to 0 when querying non-contribution activities (stars, forks, social mentions, etc.)
   - Apply timestamp filters for time-based queries  
   - Use provided parameters as defaults
   - NEVER use custom SQL queries in pipe inputs (no "q" parameter)
   - **If unsure about a parameter, include it if it's documented in the tool schema**

3. **Focus on the Task:**
   - Answer the reformulated question directly
   - Use the tools specified by the router
   - Be concise and accurate in your response`
