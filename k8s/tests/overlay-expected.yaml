# Expected overlay differences relative to base manifests
---
overlay: staging
notes:
  - Ingress uses `letsencrypt-staging` issuer and `insights.staging.lfx.dev` host/TLS secret.
  - SecretSync references staging Vault OCID `ocid1.vaultsecret.oc1..staging-placeholder`.
  - Deployments and Redis consume the `insights-runtime` secret for runtime configuration.
---
overlay: production
notes:
  - SecretSync references production Vault OCID `ocid1.vaultsecret.oc1..production-placeholder`.
  - Deployments and Redis consume the `insights-runtime` secret for runtime configuration.
